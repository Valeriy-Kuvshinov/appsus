Spirit is more than just a reptile; it's a symbol of her own resilient spirit, a spirit that refuses to succumb to the harsh conditions surrounding her. As Jade digs deeper, both literally and metaphorically, she confronts both the dangers lurking below the surface and the despair threatening to consume her. 'Holes' is a gripping tale of one woman's quest for salvation, set against an unforgiving landscape that challenges her at every turn.",

Using her database of 250 case studies, including seventy “resisters,” Druffel has ascertained nine techniques that witnesses use to ward off alien entities and even break off abductions in progress. And perhaps even more astonishing, this evidence points to the possible true identity of the greys and their link to the abducting entities of myth and folklore.",
